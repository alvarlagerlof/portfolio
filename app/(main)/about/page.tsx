          It all began with a $2 computer. How do you ask? Well, when I was younger, I played
          Minecraft a lot. Naturally, I wanted to play with my friends, so I figured I'd create a
          server for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I went to a flea market and searched for the cheapest computer I could find. For $2, I
          got an absolute wreck. Not knowing what I had bought, I took it home and installed a Linux
          distribution on it.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          It worked better than expected. But something was missing. All "cool" servers had a
          website. I wanted mine to have one too. An Apache install and some typing later, there was
          a website. It snowballed from there. Being a developer was more fun than playing the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I've experimented with many things. Everything from Android and iOS apps, to
          decentralized tic-tac-toe, to neural networks based. Along the way, I realized that I am
          becoming more and more interested in design as well. When I'm not either of those, I like
          to ski and take photos.
