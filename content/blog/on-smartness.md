Growing up, I was a geek. I've always been interested in a few technical topics. For most of my life, this has also meant that I've felt alone in these topics. But less so as I've grown older.

When I was in primary school, I would build all kinds of mechanical contraptions. Like cableways between beds, large lego towers, or robots. I wasn't very good at it at all, but I kept trying until I at least partially succeeded. I never actually _played_ though. Only building and testing were fun to me.

Meanwhile, my peers would different kinds of games like pokemon, different video games, or football. They'd also keep up with things like Eurovision. At least I think so, because I don't know. I only knew that no one did what I did.

Then came the day when everything changed. The school had an electronics workshop day. We were supposed to turn on a light using three components. A cable, a battery, and a light. You probably know, but the key here is to create a closed circuit that lets the electrons flow from one side of the battery, through the light, and back to the other side of the battery.

Since I had already done this at home, I completed the task in about 5 seconds. Meanwhile my peers tried and tried for around 20 minutes. To be very clear, I don't think they were stupid. You see, **I had spent a similar amount of time figuring that very problem out myself at home a long time before them.** I had already taken the time to understand the problem space and get comfortable with electronics.

This situation changed how a lot of my classmates saw me. Suddenly, I wsa the "smart" kid. This attention was nice at first. Becasue who doesn't want to be called smart, right? However, that smart startus wasn't that exact. Since I was smart, I must also know what 9×13, right? Spoiler: I didn't at all, I was terrible at math. How was it possible that I didn't remember all the winners in Eurovision? Similar things kept on going on since then.

The whole situation puzzled me a lot. In my mind, I wasn't very smart at all. I had just spent all the time they spent on things they liked (like football) on things I liked, like electronics. I had spent just as much time failing to make the light turn on as them.

By the way, the whole siuation repeated later in another school when we were supposed to make a serial and parallell cirutit. And countless times later. I kept on learning things I wanted myself, and got into computers, Linux and then programming early.

So if not smartness, then what? I perfer experienced. I don't consider myself particularly smart. I've just been interested in a niche problem space all my life. This makes me more experienced in these areas.

I consider someone smart if they're able to solve a novel problem in an area they are **not familiar with**. I think I've seen it happen, and I know that's probably not me. That's not to say that I'm able to compensate by knowing a lot in the areas I work in.

Even here, it useful to consider that you may not know what they know. [The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/) describes Sonder:

> n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed ...

So the next time you're amazed by the abilities of another person, consider the time they have spent on getting to that point, and be even more amazed.
