For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a geek—always interested in technical things. This has also meant that I’ve felt very alone, but it’s gotten better as I've grown older.

When I was in primary school, I would build all kinds of mechanical contraptions. Cableways between beds. Large Lego towers. Robots. By no means was I good at it, but I kept trying until I at least partially succeeded.

One day school had an electronics workshop. We were supposed to turn on a light bulb using three components: a cable, battery, and a bulb. The key here was to create a closed circuit that lets electrons flow through each component.

Then came the day when everything changed. The school had an electronics workshop day. We were supposed to turn on a light using three components. A cable, a battery, and a light. You probably know, but the key here is to create a closed circuit that lets the electrons flow from one side of the battery, through the light, and back to the other side of the battery.

Since I had already done this at home, I completed the task in seconds. Meanwhile my peers struggled with the task for several minutes. To be very clear, I don't think they were stupid. You see, **I had spent a similar amount of time solving the same problem myself at home, long before.** I was already familiar with the problem space and comfortable with electronics.

This situation changed how a lot of my classmates saw me. Suddenly, I was the "smart" kid. This attention was nice at first because who doesn't want to be called smart, right? Since I was “smart”, I should also know what 9×13 is, right? Spoiler: I didn't, I was terrible at math. And how was it possible that I didn't know all the winners in Eurovision? The list goes on and on—so many things the “smart” kid didn’t actually know. The label proved inaccurate and everyone moved on.

This puzzled me. In my own mind, I was hardly smart at all. I had simply spent all the time they spent on what they liked (like football) on things I liked, like electronics.

So if _not_ “smart”, then what? I prefer “experienced”. Being interested in a niche problem space all my life made me experienced, not smart. I consider someone smart if they're able to solve a novel problem in some area they are not familiar with.

Still, there are situations where I’ve thought someone did something really smart. But even there, it’s useful to consider that you don’t know what they’re experienced in. It reminds me of the word “Sonder,” described by [The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/) as the following:

> n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed ...

The next time you're impressed by the abilities of someone, you might be even more amazed to consider what it took to get there.
