The following is a story I've been thinking about writing for years. Both as a cautionary tale to anyone getting into photography, and as an explanation for why I stopped. I've been reluctant to share this, but here's what happened.

# Beginnings

Starting from when I was a kid, I've had a fascination with photography. I used to loan my mom's camera and capture everything that caught my eye. I wasn't any good at all at the start, but after getting my own camera as a birthday present, I improved.

Sometime after that, I started an Instagram account. At first, it was private, and only a few friends viewed what I posted. Limited reach. Getting encouragement and feedback kept me going. It wasn't obvious then, but that was the start of significant pain.

# Going public

Getting older, I made my account public. Now exposed to anyone I started using hashtags. My pictures would show up on things like #nature or #macro.

This is when I started gaining likes and followers from strangers. At first, it was delightful. _This_ many people like what I do? Wow.

What I didn’t know was that for each new like and follow, a little dopamine was sent out into my brain. Every little bit of attention was a hit of a drug I didn't know about. After a while, you get used to it—wanting more and setting ever higher standards for yourself. Did the latest post get fewer likes than the last few? The photo must be worse.

Soon, I started thinking about how my photos would be perceived even before taking them. I'd reject compositions that I liked before even clicking the shutter. All based on a vague grasp of what appeared to perform well.

# Gaming the algorithm

Set on getting more: likes, followers, comments, I soon found ways to improve my metrics:

1. Optimizing hashtags. Post with tags like #nature also used other tags. I'd locate these and fill my own posts with them. There are even websites made for this.
2. Posting at specific times. I would look at the dominant geographic regions of my followers, and map out optimal times to post. For example, lunchtime on the US west coast.
3. Faking interest. I'd view posts on a hashtag, open the profiles of the posters, and like a bunch of their posts. This led people to my profile.
4. Deleting posts. If any of my posts performed badly, I'd delete them.

# Result

Looking back at these tactics, they seem desperate. In a way, they were. I found myself in a highly competitive environment—too young to reflect on what I was doing: chasing metrics.

Using the tactics above, I reached 700 followers. All at the expense of mental health, which had gotten worse the further I got. So in March 2017, I stopped. By then, even picking up my camera gave me anxiety.

I've been thinking a lot about whom to blame here. There appears to be no simple answers. At the core, Instagram is simply a photo-sharing platform. The situation could have been prevented from my side. Still, I know that many others use it in similar ways, whether they want to or not.

# Solution (in progress)

I haven't posted anything on Instagram since then. I'd still like to get back to taking and showing some people photos, but I'm still working on the best way to do this.

For now, using my phone reduces friction a lot. Some of these go on my Unsplash, but I'm still looking for the right place.
