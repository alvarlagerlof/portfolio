Recently, someone asked me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alvarlagerlof) how I taught myself to code. In my 8 years of coding, I’ve been continuously refining my process to make it as painless as possible. This has taken me further than I could have ever imagined at the start.

Depending on where you are in your own coding adventure, this may already be things that you do. Observing how some of my friends approach learning made me think. There were things they could do to improve faster.

This article details my favorite two. Though I will note, this only works when you’ve learned the basic syntax of whatever language you’re pursing.

# Projects, projects, projects!

The first method is to do projects. Look for something that interests you or could benefit others around you. If you find something that you genuinely want to complete and share with the world, you're on to something. Motivation is one of the greatest powers at your disposal.

**Tutorials and courses do not apply here.** You may be motivated to complete them, but at the end you won’t end up with a concrete thing, except a certificate. That’s not to say they’re not good for diving deep into specific things. Don't just do this.

Don't waste too much time trying to do it in a perfect way. If you're trying out a new framework, only learn what you find necessary to achieve your goals at that time. You can always return to it later and improve as you learn new things. Also, make sure you’re not trying to learn too much at once. You’ll get stuck. **A little bit at a time consistently becomes more effective in the long term.**

# Passive learning

Let’s face it, you need a break! All that coding is tiring. Still, you want to learn. Can these two be combined? **The second method is about the breaks. **Surround yourself with content that keeps you learning. Even if you're not actively coding.

For a moment, consider a young football player. They might practice a lot. But they probably also keep up with the latest games and their favorite players on TV. Lawyers will keep up as laws change. Politician will watch news to see what other politicians do. Marketers know what’s trendy.

**Developers can keep up with what happens in the developer world too! **Luckily, there is lots of awesome content: \

- On YouTube, there are tons of recorded conferences and tutorials. Also, check out Twitch streamers focused on coding.
- For audio, there are many podcasts about code where on the usual platforms.
- Perhaps at the greatest volume — is written content. Check out platforms like Twitter, Dev.to, Hashnode and Hacker News. There are also countless terrific personal blogs.

Search like this:_ [programming language / platform / technology] + [conference / tutorial / blog / guide / news]_. I won’t mention specific people here, since I fear missing an awesome creator. I'm also not knowledgeable about all tech.

**Approach passive learning without the expectation of remembering everything. **It's better if you don't. In the back of your mind, some random things will undoubtedly stick. You’ll find use for those in the future, in unexpected places. Read, watch and listen, but don't put too much pressure on yourself to remember.

It doesn’t even have to be in the same category as what you’re working on. I regularly consume content about Rust, Android and game development — even though currently use neither.

Don't even finish the article/video/podcast if you don't find it fun. Move on in that case. **The goal here is to consume it as entertainment, not work.** Don’t code along.

# How this has worked out for me

I got into coding because I wanted to play Minecraft with my friends. How are those two connected you might ask?

Well, I realized I needed a server, so I bought an old computer and started hosting. Now, every "cool" server I encountered online had their own website. Of course, I also needed one. Before I knew it I was doing HTML and learning to use the terminal.

From there, it snowballed. My goal of having a website kept me learning whatever I needed. I also realized how much I liked to code. The website was my project, the learning was a delightful side effect.

Then what about passive learning? A few years ago, I read some blogs and noticed a curious pattern. This thing called **React** started popping up more and more often. So I checked it out and figured it would fit wonderfully for the project I had at the time. A few months later, I got a job offer. **They wanted a React developer.**

For me, it’s been a huge confidence boost to be familiar with a bunch of technologies. I haven’t even tried most of the things I encounter. Still, I take my time to learn what they’re about and how they fit in the ecosystem.

In a workplace, I like being able to say “I know about that”, instead of “I’ve never heard of that”. You can also catch up more quickly when you need to learn something.

Of course, everyone is unique and learns in a different way, but I encourage you to try these and methods. See if they work for you. With that, good luck on your journey!
