I worked on an iOS and Android app for koda.nu as a collaboration between Roboro AB and Internetstiftelsen (Swedish Internet Foundation). Koda is a website teaching kids how to code using simplified JavaScript canvas APIs. The apps where published on Play store and App store and included offline syncing, authentication and a code editor.
